This is the website for the IRT 2014 workshop. This site will contain the lecture notes, in PDF format, and the R scripts.

To download the PDFs, click the name of the .pdf file. It will open a new page with the words "View Raw". Click "View Raw" and the PDF should launch.

To download the R scripts, click the name of the .R script. It will open a new page and you will see the script there. You then have a couple of options. 1) Copy and paste it into Rstudio or 2) Click the "Raw" button. This will open yet another page. Then save that web page and open that saved file in Rstudio.
